# Insurance Company Management System

## Overview
The Insurance Company Management System is a comprehensive desktop application designed to simulate the operations of an insurance company. Developed in Java, the application offers functionalities ranging from user and policy management to intricate data handling using advanced structures like `HashMap`.

## Work done
● Developed a comprehensive desktop application in Java, simulating an insurance company's operations.
● Implemented a Three Tier Architecture to separate data, logic, and user interface layers, promoting scalability and maintainability.
● Managed user data and insurance policies with advanced data structures, transitioning from ArrayList to HashMap for efficient data retrieval and operations.
● Designed and implemented cloning functionalities, ensuring data integrity through deep and shallow copy mechanisms.
● Incorporated a command-based console interface, later evolving into a complete Graphical User Interface (GUI).
● Documented system design and processes using UML, creating class and sequence diagrams to visualize and communicate system architecture.
● Employed iterative development, completing the project in three major sprints, each introducing new functionalities and improvements.
● Validated application functionalities with test cases, comparing actual outputs with expected results to ensure system reliability.
● Presented the final application with a set of UI sketches, UML documentation, and an executable JAR file.
